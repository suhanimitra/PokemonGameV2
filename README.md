# Pokémon Game

This project contains an interactive, developed version of the Pokémon game.

Please see project guidelines under file "PA4_fall22.pdf."

The WildPokemon will start following a trainer if they're in the same location.
This triggers the boolean member I added in the Trainer class, hasPokemon, to be true.
From then onwards, the Trainer's health gets decremented more intensely than before by the attack member of the WildPokemon.

There is functionality in order to fulfill the prior tasks and generally added comments to explain how they work.
